WashU CSE330S Final Project - WashU Freelancer Hub

My idea is to create a website where WashU-affiliated people can sign on and post requests for website building, graphic designs, and other online services. This site will be open to anyone with a WashU email, which will require authentication. Anyone can post a project with a description, date needed, whether it is paid or unpaid, and can be marked as “claimed” by potential workers so the person requesting the service will be able to choose who they want completing their project. People can list themselves as available for work and can create their own profiles with tags that identify their skills and list their past work and experience.
